Ray Tracing in One Weekend ... in Rust
=====================================

Joined the crowd and followed
[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](http://in1weekend.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html)
using Rust.

The code is mostly faithful to the source. The only significant change was to use `Option<>` instead of reference args + bool.
